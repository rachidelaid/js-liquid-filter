# JS Liquid Filter

Try to sort the colored liquid in the glasses until all colors in the same glass. A challenging yet relaxing game to exercise your brain!

- Tap any glass to pour liquid to another glass.
- The rule is that you can only pour the liquid if it is linked to the same color and there‚Äôre enough space on the glass.
